### GTK/Python X-Debug Trace-File-Viewer

Hello, this is a tiny little one-day project of mine to create a native GUI to analyze X-Debug Trace-Files.
Just call it with `python main.py` and choose your (uncompressed!) xt file.

Make sure the file-type is set to "Machine Readable" in your X-Debug config. Have fun! :-)
